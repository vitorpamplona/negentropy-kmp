# Negentropy Kotlin Multiplatform

Kotlin multiplatform implementation of Negentropy Range-Based-Set-Reconciliation protocol.

It's basically a binary search set-reconciliation algorithm.
You can read about the details [here](https://logperiodic.com/rbsr.html).
This code is basically a re-implementation of [Doug Hoyte's repository here](https://github.com/hoytech/negentropy)

## Storage

First, you need to create a storage instance. Currently only `Vector` is implemented.
Add all the items in your collection with `insert(timestamp, hash)` and call `seal()`

    StorageVector().apply {
        insert(1678011277, "eb6b05c2e3b008592ac666594d78ed83e7b9ab30f825b9b08878128f7500008c")
        insert(1678011278, "39b916432333e069a4386917609215cc688eb99f06fed01aadc29b1b4b92d6f0")
        insert(1678011279, "abc81d58ebe3b9a87100d47f58bf15e9b1cbf62d38623f11d0f0d17179f5f3ba")

        seal()
    }

*  `timestamp` should be a unix timestamp
*  `id` should be a byte array of the event id

## Reconciliation

Create a Negentropy object:

    val ne = Negentropy(storage, 50_000)

* The second parameter (`50_000` above) is the `frameSizeLimit`. This can be omitted (or `0`) to permit unlimited-sized frames.

On the client-side, create an initial message, and then transmit it to the server, receive the response, and `reconcile` until complete (signified by returning `null` for `newMsg`):

    val msg = ne.initiate();

    while (msg !== null) {
        val response = <queryServer>(msg);
        val result = ne.reconcile(msgClient)
        val have = result.needIds
        val need = result.sendIds
        
        msg = result.msg;
        // handle have/need (there may be duplicates from previous calls to reconcile())
    }

*  The output `msg`s and the IDs in the `have`/`need` arrays are hex strings.

The server-side is similar, except it doesn't create an initial message, there are no `have`/`need` arrays, and `newMsg` will never be `null`:

    while (1) {
        val msg = <receiveMsgFromClient>();
        val reconciled = ne.reconcile(msg);
        respondToClient(reconciled.msg);
    }

* The `initiate()` and `reconcile()` methods are not suspending functions but they will take a while to process.

## Developer Setup

Make sure to have the following pre-requisites installed:
1. Java 17+
2. Android Studio or IntelliJ Idea CE

## Building

Build the app:
```bash
./gradlew clean assemble
```

## Testing
```bash
./gradlew allTests
```

## Running Conformance Tests with other implementations

Clone [Doug Hoyte's repository here](https://github.com/hoytech/negentropy) and clone this repository inside of it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoytech/negentropy
cd negentropy
git clone https://github.com/vitorpamplona/negentropy-kmp
cd negentropy-kmp
```

Create a `local.properties` file that points to your Android SDK. If you are using Android Studio,
the IDE performs this step for you.

For example:

```bash
echo "sdk.dir=/Users/<your user>/Library/Android/sdk" > local.properties
```

Run `./gradlew assemble` to generate the `.jar` for the library and

```bash
perl test.pl kotlin,js
```

to run the test with a kotlin node and a javascript node

## Publishing

Install GnuPG and generate a key:

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

Run `gpg --list-keys` to show your GPG keys.

Distribute the public key:

```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys <pubkey>
```

Export your private key to a file

```bash
gpg --export-secret-keys > ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

Generate a User Token on MavenCentral

To publish from local, and add the following fields to your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties file:

```properties
mavenCentralUsername=<maven user>
mavenCentralPassword=<maven password>
signing.keyId=<gpg key id>
signing.password=<gpg key passphrase>
signing.secretKeyRingFile=<yourhome>/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

Then run

```bash
./gradlew publishAllPublicationsToMavenCentral --no-configuration-cache
```

To publish from GitHub Actions, export your private key as a base64 string:

```bash
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor <key-id> ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg | grep -v '\-\-' | grep -v '^=.' | tr -d '\n'
```

and add the following secrets to your GitHub secrets:

```properties
SONATYPE_USERNAME=<maven user>
SONATYPE_PASSWORD=<maven password>
SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64versionOfTheFile>
SIGNING_PASSWORD=<gpg key passphrase>
```

And just tag the release version starting with `v`
